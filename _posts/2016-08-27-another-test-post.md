What's up with equations?

Here's one: \\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\\). That should be inline. Here's one with trickier characters in it: \\(E[X \mid Y] = \int _{-\infty} ^ \infty \frac{xf(x,y)}{f(y)}dy \\). 

And on a single line:

$$\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi}{6}$$

Let's see what we get.
