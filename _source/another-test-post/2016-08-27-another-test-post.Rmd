I want to figure out what's going on with lists.

* Here's a list
* Here's another item in the list
  + Here's a sub item
  + here's another sub item
* back to main

### And an ordered list?

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
  + Sub item

Also, equations? \\(E\left[Y\mid X\right] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{yf(x,y)}{f(x)} dy \\)

$$E\left[Y\mid X\right] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{yf(x,y)}{f(x)} dy$$
