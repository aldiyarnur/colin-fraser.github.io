<img src="/images/image.jpg" width="300px"  style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;"/>My name is Colin. I live and work in Vancouver, BC. I'm a data scientist at my job where I work on things like customer analytics and building models of customer behaviour, as well as experimental design. I do a whole lot of my work with R, but I also like doing things with Python. I'll write about all kinds of different things here.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at colin dot r dot fraser at gmail dot com, [tweet at me](twitter.com/colin_fraser), or, I don't know, it's pretty easy to get in touch with people on the internet these days.

### About this blog

This blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the theme is a bastardization of [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)'s attractive [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com). I write everything in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) through Rstudio, which I figured out how to do with [these instructions](https://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/). It's a bit of a Rube Goldberg contraption but once you get it set up it's really nice actually.
